# IRON JUMP

Iron Jump is a game based of the original _Doodle_Jump_. The objective of the game is to get the highest score you can, but the higher is the score, the difficulty increases eventually (less platforms, more enemies)
There's 2 types of platforms: green and the broken ones. The main difference; you can stand on greens and not on the broken platforms
